## My job

My job is to make sure that IT enables businesses to succeed with integrity. I accomplish that by working with groups outside IT to understand our role and translating that back into direction and perspective for IT. To be succesful, I need to be secure that our responsibilities are met so my focus can be outward from IT. Our success depends on everyone in IT being engaged and working together.  

Past that, I really enjoy seeing everyone grow and succeed. Growing businesses inevitably produce new opportunities. I want to learn what you consider success and I want to be a part of helping you reach for it.

## Everyone's Job

I've found that the best teams take individual and team ownership of **business** success. They work _with integrity_ and _as a team_. Some of the things I've found that help are:

- Assume the best intentions and work hard to maintain trust. Remember that 50/50 feels like 60/40.
- Steel sharpens steel, so work to make each other better. Respectful but difficult conversations are necessary and good.
- Understand that you represent the team, so build positive relationships and make commitments with care. Block off time on your calendar when you make a commitment.
- Be in control of your attention. Reduce distractions and find ways to work efficiently.

## Some of the things you'll hear me say . . .

- Play the cards in your hand, not the cards you want
- Iteratate over 80% solutions
- Have creative impatience (my version of "fail early")
- It's not what you preach, it's what you tolerate
- Early is on-time, on-time is late, late is dead

## Communications

We have a lot of ways to communicate, but I typically disable most alerts and the only interruption I allow is a call. I look at email and IM roughly every hour and try to return messages by end of day. Urgent issues should result in a voice call (if not answered, call back as a "Bat signal"). I expect you to escalate appropriately and to bring a recommended solution and alternative along with every problem. If there's an ongoing issue _never let me be surprised_.

I'll respect calendars, so keep yours up to date. I try to schedule non-urgent calls. One way to reduce my calls is to track commitments as tickets and to keep documentation current. I tend to call during business hours because I find it to be higher bandwidth. I will send messages outside of business hours just to "get it out of my brain", but I don't typically expect a response.

Understand that there may be business reasons that I can't share information with you, but you can count on me to not dissemble.

## Meetings

We'll meet once a week as a team. That meeting will focus on KPIs and will include post-mortems of critical events.

We'll meet once a week for one-on-ones. That agenda is determined by you. I've found that what works best is to start with the most important issues. A good way to start is to identify what has become clear to you in the last week.
